# Orbital Mechanics Simulator

Orbital Mechanics Simulator is the title of my project for the CISC 4900 Independent Projects course. It is a spaceflight simulator which models realistic orbits around celestial bodies using Newtonian physics and patched conics.

## Abstract

Orbital mechanics are an often misunderstood aspect of spaceflight, but one which can be explained through hands-on piloting of a simulated spacecraft which follow a few basic mathematical equations. In this project, I will focus on teaching how a few basic laws of Newtonian physics can result in many types of orbits around celestial bodies, and how to figure out the most efficient way to get from one planet or moon to another. Along the way, I may touch upon the Oberth effect, Hohmann transfers, gravity assists, patched conics, the rocket equation, and other spaceflight-related concepts. By turning it into a game to find the most efficient solution, learning becomes fun and accessible to everyone.

## Diagrams

The `Diagrams` folder contains the main slide deck for this project and source images used for it. This slide deck is like the pitch deck for the project, and includes items required for the Diagrams deliverables assignment.

## Unity files

There will be a folder containing the files used by the Unity project, after I have figured out the best practices for using git with Unity.
