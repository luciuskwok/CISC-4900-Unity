# Orbital Mechanics Simulator

Orbital Mechanics Simulator is the title of my project for the CISC 4900 Independent Projects course. It is a spaceflight simulator which models realistic orbits around celestial bodies using Newtonian physics and patched conics.

## Abstract

Orbital mechanics are an often misunderstood aspect of spaceflight, but one which can be explained through hands-on piloting of a simulated spacecraft which follow a few basic mathematical equations. In this project, I will focus on teaching how a few basic laws of Newtonian physics can result in many types of orbits around celestial bodies, and how to figure out the most efficient way to get from one planet or moon to another. Along the way, I may touch upon the Oberth effect, Hohmann transfers, gravity assists, patched conics, the rocket equation, and other spaceflight-related concepts. By turning it into a game to find the most efficient solution, learning becomes fun and accessible to everyone.

## Unity Project Folder "OMS"

The root folder for the Unity project is named `OMS`.

## Other Folders

Most of the other folders are for files required by the Independent Project course.

The `Slides` folder contains the presentation slide deck for this project and source images used for it. This slide deck is like the pitch deck for the project.

The `Sketches` folder contains pencil-and-paper sketches I made, mostly for UI.

The `Timelogs` folder contains PDF snapshots of my time logs for documenting the hours I put into the project during the Spring 2025 semester.
